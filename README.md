# CDP-and-Non-CDP-files-sep
CDP and Non CDP files counting script . 
This script uses the paramiko library to connect to Cisco devices over SSH, runs a command to show CDP neighbors, and then extracts and prints the CDP information. Please make sure to replace "your_username", "your_password", and the "show cdp neighbors" command with your actual credentials and the appropriate command for your Cisco devices.
